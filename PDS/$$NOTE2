John Kalinich told this to me verbally.  (SG - 2010/01/27)


  Somebody was running VTOCLIST against all of the DASD in his
shop, and he noticed that storage was being tied up.  JK looked
into FREEMAIN and it didn't help.  Then he looked into FREEPOOL
and it did help.  So here is the modified code, with the extra
FREEPOOL invocations.

  I didn't think it was necessary to keep the old source for
VTOCLIST that didn't do the FREEPOOL, because it was probably
imperfect code anyway, that was no more reliable or better than
the present code.  So I replaced the old code with the present
code.  (SG)
