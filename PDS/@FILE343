//***FILE 343 is a VTOCLIST program from John Kalinich of Computer  *   FILE 343
//*           Sciences Corp. in St. Louis, Missouri.  This program  *   FILE 343
//*           originally came from a UK G.U.I.D.E. tape, and        *   FILE 343
//*           was written by Peter Havercan.  It has been enhanced  *   FILE 343
//*           for operating system improvements several times, by   *   FILE 343
//*           John Kalinich.  This code currently does not support  *   FILE 343
//*           Indexed VTOC freespace calculations, but besides that *   FILE 343
//*           it works fine on modern systems.                      *   FILE 343
//*                                                                 *   FILE 343

//*    Updated:  06/20/03  to bypass HFS files and change BAL       *   FILE 343
//*                        an BALR instructions to BAS and BASR.    *   FILE 343
//*    Updated:  03/25/02  with old version still included.         *   FILE 343
//*                                                                 *   FILE 343
//*    Here is a new VTOCLIST with 3390-27 (or 32) large DASD       *   FILE 343
//*    support.  I had to sacrifice the KEYLEN field in the         *   FILE 343
//*    report to make room for the larger track and cylinder        *   FILE 343
//*    sizes.  I renamed the old version with a "zero" in the       *   FILE 343
//*    3rd position of VTxCLIST.                                    *   FILE 343
//*                                                                 *   FILE 343
